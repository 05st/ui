**This is pre-alpha software.**

V UI is a cross-platform UI toolkit for Windows, macOS, Linux, and soon Android, iOS and the web (JS/WASM).
V UI uses native widgets on Windows and macOS, on all other platforms the widgets are drawn by V UI.
Right now only the non-native widgets are available.

This is a very early version of the library, lots of features are missing (layouts, certain widgets, etc),
lots of things will change.

There will be a declarative version of the API, similar to SwiftUI.

V UI is licensed under GPL3. A commercial license will be available.

Open-source projects will have access to the commercial license for free.
That means that if you have an open-source non-GPL project, you won't have to relicense it under GPL to use V UI.

Every single feature will be open-sourced right away and available under both licenses.
